# Portfolio - WP
This is an older version of my portfolio ([jendowns.com](http://www.jendowns.com/)). It started out as a static Bootstrap site with multiple design iterations, and then I removed Bootstrap & refactored it as a WordPress theme.

In January 2017, I redesigned and refactored my site again. This time, I moved it into Node.js + Express and integrated a headless CMS. The new repo for my site is now [portfolio-node](https://github.com/jendowns/portfolio-node). I'm keeping this repo separate because it's so different, in terms of structure and environment.
